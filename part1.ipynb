    "# Final Project Part 1 - Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "For my final project, I will be using a dataset of email responders to journal article submission campaigns from Q1 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis, Assumptions, and Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "I am looking to use this data to figure out which variables may affect the recipients’ engagements with email campaigns of two differing academic disciplines. My assumption is that features surrounding previous article submission, recipient supplied interest codes matches, prior engagement with similar campaigns, and individual features may all affect the engagement \n",
    "\n",
    "This information could help with more precise campaign targeting, with the aim of raising engagement and reducing of ‘overmailing’ of unlikely engagement prospects, ultimately raising article submission revenue and contact retention. I want to use this existing data to create a model that will predict email campaign engagement in several key disciplines\n",
    "\n",
    "## Risks and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The main limitation of using this dataset is that it only includes recent data, due to the sheer scale of data available when looking over a larger period. However the nature of this specific part of the business (journal article submission) has seen sea-changes in the last 18 months, so using only recent data is likely to be a better reflection of current trends for use in the working model\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown below, this dataset includes the campaign recipients, campaign metadata, indicators for academic contacts, china based contacts, prior article submission, recent article submission, interest code matches (broad and precise), prior engagement and recent engagement (and their value counts) along with the key target variable of engagement (campaign open) along with active engagement (click) and disengagement (unsubscribes) which could potentially be combined into an 'engagement type' for the key target variable. This data was drawn from Q1 campaigning data, from which a random subset has been drawn:\n"
